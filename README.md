This was an learning expiriment for me. As a Java/bash main(lol), it was fun to mess around with the complex data types of python to try and create cool looking, in line colored reports. 

There is also the origional pearl vertions I made becasue I saw alot of WHM was coded in pearl and I thought "Well that looks fun" and welp ended up coding my first bit of pearl ever, so if you wann see som TERRIBLE code look there haha!
